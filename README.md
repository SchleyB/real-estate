App was created using tutorial at https://github.com/bryantheastronaut/mernCommentBox.

I created it with create-react-app, where the configuration cannot be changed, and ran npm run eject, which
gives us full control over all the processes so that we can modify them and add whatever else we want into the
build process.

Eslint config was added with airbnb/react configuration.

To get started, run 'npm install' then 'npm run start-dev' which starts server.
Also must be running database with mongod command in other window.

Go to localhost:3001

CRUD functionality is working.

TODO:
